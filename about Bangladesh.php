			<p> Bangladesh,officially the People's Republic of 

Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is bordered 

by India to its west, north and east; Burma to its 

southeast and separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the 

Chickenâ€™s Neck corridor. To its south, it faces the 

Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is the worlds eighth-most 

populous country, with over 160 million people, and 

among the most densely populated countries. It forms 

part of the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal, along 

with the neighbouring Indian states of West Bengal and 

Tripura.The present-day borders of Bangladesh took 

shape during the Partition of Bengal and British India 

in 1947, when the region used to be known as East 

Pakistan, as a part of the newly formed state of 

Pakistan. It was separated from West Pakistan by 1,400 

km of Indian territory. Due to political exclusion, 

ethnic and linguistic discrimination and economic 

neglect by the politically dominant western wing, 

nationalism, popular agitation and civil disobedience 

led to the Bangladesh Liberation War and independence 

in 1971. After independence, the new state endured 

poverty, famine, political turmoil and military coups. 

The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed 

by relative calm and economic progress. In 2014, the 

Bangladeshi general election was boycotted by major 

opposition parties, resulting in a parliament and 

government dominated by the Awami League and its 

smaller coalition partners.Bangladesh is a unitary 

parliamentary republic with an elected parliament 

called the Jatiyo Sangshad. The native Bengalis form 

the countrys largest ethnic group, along with 

indigenous peoples in northern and southeastern 

districts. Geographically, the country is dominated by 

the fertile Bengal delta, the world's largest delta. 

This also gives Bangladesh a unique name tag The land 

of rivers.Bangladesh is identified as a Next Eleven 

country which has an economy larger than of countries 

like Vietnam, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Qatar 

etc.[9] It has achieved significant strides in human 

and social development since independence, including 

in progress in gender equity, universal primary 

education, food production, health and population 

control.[10][11][12] However, Bangladesh continues to 

face numerous political, economic, social and 

environmental challenges, including political 

instability, corruption, poverty, overpopulation and 

climate change.Bangladesh is a founding member of 

SAARC, the Developing 8 Countries and BIMSTEC. It 

contributes one of the largest peacekeeping forces to 

the United Nations. It is a member of the Commonwealth 

of Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation 

and the Non-Aligned Movement.</p>
