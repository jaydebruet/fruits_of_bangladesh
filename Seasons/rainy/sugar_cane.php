Introduction

Sugar cane is the source of much of the worlds sugar. Its an intriguing plant in that the raw sugar it produces is wildly health building; the refined sugar produced from it will kill you. A plant I am researching at the moment, you will be hearing more about this as the story develops. 

Sugar cane is grown in over 110 countries with an estimated total production of 1,591 million metric tons. In most countries where sugarcane is cultivated, there are several foods and popular dishes derived directly from it, such as raw sugarcane chewed to extract the juice. Sugarcane Juice Combining fresh juice, extracted by hand or small mills, with a touch of lemon and ice to make a popular drink. A sugar cane baton is actually inedible but contains naturally sweet juice and is enjoyed as a snack. Cut away the outer covering and chew on the stalk until all the juice is gone. Peeled and slice as swizzle sticks to use in iced or hot drinks. Cane pulp should not be swallowed.
